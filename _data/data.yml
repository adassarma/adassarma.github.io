        details: |
          Formulated kernels
          for predicting density and total energy of Beryllium atoms from snapshots. Proposed kernels outperformed RBF
          kernel by two orders of magnitude and gave comparable results to the state of the art neural network models.
      - role: Summer Research Internship
        time: 2021-2022
        company: Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany
        details: |
          Worked on a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem for decoding LDPC codes in AWGN & Rayleigh
          Fading Channel scenarios. Implemented a complete simulation of a communication system and tested under
          different channel noise intensities. Achieved lower Bit Error Rates using a programmable annealing device as
          compared to Max-Belief Decoding strategies.
